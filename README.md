## Introduction

The objective of this analysis is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a fictitious immunization dataset and develop an interactive dashboard. The dashboard aims to provide insights into the performance of immunization programs using available data.
## Disclaimer: 
The dataset and dashboard do not represent any real company, organization, or country. The data is fictitious.

### Problem Statement 

This immunization dashboard analyzes key performance indicators (KPIs), including vaccine uptake, immunization coverage rates, healthcare expenses, and mortality rates among immunized patients. The analysis also examines trends in immunization over time and patient demographics such as age and location.

### Methodology

The immunization dataset was uploaded from a PostgreSQL database into Power BI. Using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) functions, additional KPIs were created to provide a more comprehensive analysis.

### Skills/Concepts Demonstrated

The following Power BI features and concepts were utilized:
•	Data Cleaning using Power Query
•	Data Modeling
•	DAX to create custom KPIs
•	Interactive Dashboard Creation

### Key Insights

1.	Total Number of Immunized Patients:
The total number of immunized patients is 11,000. The highest number of immunizations occurred in the 50+ age group, followed by the 41-50, 31-40, 21-30, 11-15, and 0-5 age groups. Additionally, patients with health coverage accounted for the highest number of immunizations. Holliston City contributed 
significantly to the overall number of immunizations.

2.	Yearly Trends: 
The number of immunized patients fluctuates yearly, with increases and decreases observed between different years. The year 1966 saw the highest number of immunized patients.

3.	Mortality Rate: 
The mortality rate among immunized patients is 12%. Notably, age groups with the highest number of immunized patients tend to have lower mortality rates, while age groups with fewer immunized patients exhibit higher mortality rates.

4.	Impact of Health Coverage: 
Health coverage plays a significant role in immunization uptake. Patients with health coverage are more likely to be immunized, while those without coverage have the lowest immunization rates.

5.	Vaccine Uptake: 
The Seasonal Flu Vaccine and the Five-Dose Tetanus Vaccine have the highest vaccine uptake, likely due to their lower associated healthcare expenses. In contrast, the Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine and the Meningococcal (A, C, Y, W-135) Polysaccharide-Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine (MCV4P) have the lowest uptake and the highest average healthcare costs.

6.	Immunization by Location: 
Holliston, Boston, Worcester, and Chelsea are the cities with the highest number of immunizations, while Rowley, Topsfield, Whitinsville, and Orleans have the lowest immunization counts.


### Recommendations

1.	Targeted Vaccination Campaigns for Vulnerable Age Groups: 
Since older age groups (50+) and those with health coverage have higher immunization rates, it may be beneficial to target younger age groups (0-5, 11-15) with educational campaigns and outreach programs to increase immunization rates and reduce mortality.

2.	Expand Access to Health Coverage: 
Given the significant impact of health coverage on immunization rates, policies should be focused on expanding access to affordable health coverage, especially in low-immunization regions.

3.	Promote Lower-Cost Vaccines: 
The success of vaccines like the Seasonal Flu Vaccine and Five-Dose Tetanus Vaccine can be attributed to their lower health expenses. Promoting and subsidizing other vaccines with higher costs, like the Valent Pneumococcal and MCV4P vaccines, could help boost uptake in those areas.

4.	Monitor Yearly Trends and Resource Allocation: 
The fluctuating yearly trend in immunizations suggests the need for dynamic resource allocation. More healthcare resources should be allocated to periods and locations showing a decline in immunizations to ensure consistent immunization coverage over time.

5.	Focus on Low-Immunization Cities: 
Cities like Rowley, Topsfield, Whitinsville, and Orleans, which have the lowest immunization numbers, should be prioritized for public health initiatives aimed at improving vaccination coverage, such as mobile immunization clinics or increased community outreach efforts.
